# Real-Life Data Analytics Project using Power BI in Hospitality Domain

## Project Overview
We embarked on a real-life data analytics project using Power BI in the hospitality domain. Our primary objective was to generate revenue insights for a fictional hotel chain called "atliq Grants" by creating a comprehensive dashboard. The project involved collaborating with a revenue manager at a multinational hotel chain, to understand his requirements and translate them into actionable visualizations.

### Key Aspects
Throughout the project, we focused on three key aspects:

1. **Understanding the Problem Statement:** We delved into the data set provided for the project, which mimicked real-life scenarios in the hospitality industry. By analyzing various metrics such as occupancy rates, revenue per available room (RevPAR), and average daily rate (ADR), we aimed to uncover valuable insights that could drive strategic decision-making.

2. **Data Transformation and Modeling:** We imported the data into Power BI, performed data transformation, and created a data model to establish relationships between different data tables. This step was crucial in ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the insights derived from the dashboard.

3. **Dashboard Creation:** Using the transformed data, we built a dashboard that included key performance indicators (KPIs), trend charts, and visualizations to analyze booking data, room types, and revenue generation. The dashboard provided a holistic view of the hotel chain's performance and highlighted areas for improvement.

### Problems Solved
The problems that the dashboard aimed to solve included:

- **Identifying Pricing Opportunities:** By analyzing pricing strategies and revenue trends, the dashboard could help optimize pricing strategies to maximize revenue and profitability.

- **Analyzing Property Performance:** The dashboard allowed us to identify underperforming properties based on occupancy rates and average ratings, enabling targeted interventions to improve performance.

- **Optimizing Channel Mix:** By analyzing booking channels and their impact on revenue generation, the dashboard could help optimize the channel mix to drive more direct bookings and increase revenue.

## Conclusion
Overall, the project showcased the power of data analytics in the hospitality industry and highlighted the importance of leveraging data-driven insights to make informed business decisions. The dashboard served as a valuable tool for revenue management, performance analysis, and strategic planning in the hotel chain.
